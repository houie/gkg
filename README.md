This is a personal project that will (hopefully) one day be a fully usable draft picker for our Los Angeles Kings
season ticket holder draft.

Each person (known as a Shareholder) puts in a certain amount of money into the pool. The more money a Shareholder puts
in, the more Shares the Shareholder owns. The draft is a way for the games to be fairly divvied up among all the
Shareholders.

**Notes:**
1. With 41 regular season home games, there are 82 pairs of tickets.
2. Prior to the draft, the seat owners (majority shareholders) each take their choice pair, leaving 80 pairs for the draft.
3. At draft time, each shareholder draws one letter per share. The draft uses a serpentine method with 3rd round reversal, starting with Round 1 Share A.
4. When it is a person's turn to pick, they can select any available game. They make their selection, then the selection proceeds to the next person in order. They will make their next pick whenever their name appears in the selection list again.
5. If a person wants all 4 seats (2 pairs) for a particular game, they make their selection from any game that currently has 4 seats available. They forfeit their next pick when their name appears in the selection list again.
